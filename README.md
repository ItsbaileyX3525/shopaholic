# Shopaholic

What is shopaholic? Well well well, here I am to tell you that shopaholic is the best new game on the block. In the game you will find yourself looting chests, opening bottles and being the best hobo you can! After going to the coffee shop you bought yourself a yummy treat and now you are in debt.

Find barrels, bins, buckets or whatever looks interactable and find some coins in them so you can pay back the owner of the coffee shop. If you don't get enough coins, well... She won't be happy.

## Features

### CS2 inspired opening

When you find an object you can interact with, you can press "E" to start a case opening sequence where you could get an item worth 20 coins or an item worth 2 coins, it all depends on your luck!

### Abilities

On day 2 onwards you can speak to "The Dealer" who, for your coins, will sell you much needed upgrades to progress to the higher days. Without him you'd have to be really lucky to get past day 14!

### Bunny hopping

Yea you can bunny hop ig

## Cloning and setting up for yourself

I don't know why you'd want to do this but you can clone this repo and import it into godot and click run.

Futhermore you can export it to windows, linux or html/web from the "Project" menu.
